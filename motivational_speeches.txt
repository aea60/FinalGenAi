Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.

Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.

Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, 'I will try again tomorrow.'

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

It always seems impossible until it's done.

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.

Greatness is not given — it is earned through relentless pursuit.

Every morning is a new chance to rewrite your story.

Your dreams don’t work unless you do.

When you feel like quitting, remember why you started.

You weren’t born to be average — you were born to stand out.

Discomfort is the birthplace of real growth.

Every failure is a staircase to success, not a dead end.

The only limits that exist are the ones you accept.

Success is silent; let your results speak.

A strong mindset breaks more barriers than talent alone.

One step forward is still progress — keep walking.

It’s not about having time; it’s about making time.

Your potential is waiting for permission — give it today.

Be the energy you want to attract.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

The obstacle is not blocking the path — it *is* the path.

Effort will always outshine excuses.

Momentum is built, not given — start with one action.

You can’t control everything, but you can control your effort.

Don’t wait for confidence — create it with consistency.
